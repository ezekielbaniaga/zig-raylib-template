  This represents a straightforward application of the raylib library in Zig version 0.11.0.
</p>


<p align="center">
Quick GIT Note: The libraries included here are cloned using git submodule, which means that when you clone this project, you won't receive the latest version of raylib. This is due to submodules being linked to specific commit IDs.
</p>

<h3 align="center">What about raygui?</h3>
<p align="center">
  Absolutely! raygui has also been included as a submodule. With any luck, I'll find the time to implement it in this template as well.
